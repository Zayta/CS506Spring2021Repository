# Limitations: 
* No longitude/latitude provided in dataset, would need to look up each region in a map to find out which space they take up
* Units / parcels of this dataset are unclear - when/if building amenities in these spaces, would need to query how much space those amenities take up


Questions:
* What do these headers mean: PROTECTION,  TYPECODE, ZonAgg, TypeLong, OS_Own_Jur, OS_Mngmnt, POS, PA, AgncyJuris, Shape_STArea__, Shape_STLength__, ShapeSTArea,  and ShapeSTLength? 
* Do we need any of the above? ZonAgg and TypeLong look relevant from their data values but not sure what the others are.
